# wabot
Standalone WhatsApp chatbot.

## How to install
Checkout the *Constants* class in the *core* folder. There, add the last Selenium driver to the path it says (or change it if you don't like),
a .json file where you put your chat friends contact names and LoL names (or whatever game you adapt the bot at) aswell as the API keys you need.

So now, just "java -cp wabot.jar com.xegami.wabot.Main" the compiled project an it will start running. 
Take in consideration that you would need an alternative WhatsApp account/number to have access to the WhatsApp web page.

## How to use
All the commands avaliable that I made are in the *TftService* class. Modify them at your wish.
